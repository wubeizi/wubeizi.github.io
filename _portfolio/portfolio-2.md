The Smart University Big Data Platform is used to provide users with accurate analysis and recommendations of higher education institutions. It should have functions such as providing specific enrollment information of universities, providing comprehensive comparative analysis of target universities, and ultimately helping users complete satisfactory volunteer applications. The system provides users with information display of all 985/211 universities in China, providing comprehensive comparative analysis and enrollment information analysis among target universities, and realizing the analysis and recommendation function of universities.üñ•Ô∏èüì∂<br/>

The code repository for this project is located at: [<b>University-Analysis-and-Recommendation-System</b>](https://github.com/wubeizi/University-Analysis-and-Recommendation-System).<br/>

This project mainly defines the requirements of a smart university big data platform, consisting of five modules: university data analysis, university recommendation system, volunteer application recommendation system, user settings, and administrator module.
- <b>Login</b>üîë: The user enters the homepage, enters their nickname and password in the login box, and clicks the button to enter the background for verification. If the verification is successful, they enter the smart university big data platform. If the verification is not successful, they will go to the login box and be prompted with the reason for the user's error. This process continues until the user information is verified, followed by subsequent operations that pass the verification until the end.<br/><p align="center"><img src='/images/UARS7.png'></p>
- <b>Register</b>üì´Ô∏è: The user enters the homepage, clicks to create an account, enters their nickname and password in the registration box, and clicks the button to enter the background for verification. If the verification is successful, the user is notified that the account creation was successful and redirected to the login page for login. If the verification is not successful, the user is prompted with the reason for the error. This process continues until the user successfully creates the account information, and then redirects to the login interface for login.<br/><p align="center"><img src='/images/UARS8.png'></p>
