With the popularity of smartphones, users need various application software, and music players are definitely essential. With the widespread use of computers and the rapid development of the mobile phone market, various audio resources are also widely circulated online. These resource cards are common, but have gradually become an essential part of people's lives. So various mobile phone players have also followed suit, but many players blindly pursue fancy appearance and huge functions, causing a lot of resource waste on users' phones, such as high CPU, memory usage, etc. When users need multitasking operations, they are greatly affected and bring a lot of inconvenience. For most ordinary users, many functions are useless and useless. Based on this, this project aims to design a simple and pure music player. The entire project includes four modules: login and registration module, personal information module, playback module, and playlist module. The overall architecture of the project is concise and clear.🎶🎼<br/>

This project is the author's first formal and complete project, mainly developed in <font color=blue><b>C</b></font> language. It not only gave the author a deeper understanding of many knowledge points in C language, but also learned a lot of new knowledge. At the same time, the development process involves team collaboration, which is also the first time I have had such a collaborative experience. Although the project itself was not very outstanding, for me, it was the first step in software development.
