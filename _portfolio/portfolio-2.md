This system is an independently developed website that provides comprehensive management of volunteers and volunteer service promotion for the Sichuan Volunteer Service Activity Center in the system.<br/>

The code repository for this project is located at: <a href="https://github.com/wubeizi/volunteer_hub" target="_blank"><b>Volunteer Cloud Media</b></a>.<br/>

This project mainly defines the requirements for volunteer cloud media, consisting of four modules: content display area, video display area, personal information area, and system management area.
- <b>Login</b>üîë: The user enters the homepage, enters their nickname and password in the login box, and clicks the button to enter the background for verification. If the verification is successful, they enter the volunteer cloud media. If the verification is not successful, they will go to the login box and be prompted with the reason for the user's error. This process continues until the user information is verified, followed by subsequent operations that pass the verification until the end.<br/><img src='/images/VCM/login.png'>
- <b>Register</b>üì´Ô∏è: The user enters the login page, clicks to register an account, enters their username, password, and email in the registration box, and clicks the button to enter the background for verification. If the verification is successful, the user is notified that the account creation was successful and redirected to the login page for login. If the verification is not successful, the user will be prompted with the reason for the error. This will continue until the user information is successfully created, and then the user will be redirected to the login interface for login.<br/><img src='/images/VCM/register.png'>
