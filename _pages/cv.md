Education
======
* B.E. in Software Engineering, Sichuan University, 2021-now
* MA.Sc in Computer Science, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 2025(expected)

Research Experience
======
* <b>September, 2023 - Present: Access Line - A Long Term Traffic Flow Prediction System Based on DGCTransformer</b>
  * Sichuan University
  * Paper(expected): "DGCTransformer: A Dynamic Global Causal Transformer for Flow Prediction"
  * The aim of this project is to utilize the inherent graph properties of urban transportation networks to abstract urban traffic flow into graph data, propose the DGCTransformer, integrate global features using the Transformer's temporal processing capabilities, introduce GAT and GRU modules to focus on local dynamic spatiotemporal causal features of preprocessed data, complete temporal flow prediction through multi road traffic flow data, and integrate it into a visual interactive platform to provide decision support for intelligent travel.

* <b>September, 2023 - Present: AI Assisted Generation System for Lower Back Pain Rehabilitation Plans Based on Clinical Knowledge Graph</b>
  * Sichuan University
  * Paper(expected): 
  * In response to lower back pain, this project has developed a personalized, systematic, and standardized AI rehabilitation medical plan assistance system based on evidence-based medicine and West China Rehabilitation Clinical Standard Data Construction Knowledge Graph. The project will convert various types of cleaned data into graph databases and store them in the neo4j database through technologies such as BERT+CRF. This system has the characteristics of accurate data, efficient treatment, and independent generation without the need for PT intervention, which can greatly improve the diagnostic and therapeutic efficiency of rehabilitation physicians and therapists.

* <b>November, 2022 - September, 2023: Adaptive Non-contact Real-time Heart Rate Detection Based on Facial Video</b>
  * Sichuan University
  * Report(unpublished): <a href="http://wubeizi.github.io/files/MUSIC.pdf" target="_blank">"Analysis and simulation reproduction of MUSIC algorithm based on facial video heart rate estimation"</a>
  * By collecting facial videos captured by cameras, ROI weighted tracking, facial detection algorithms, and Euler signal amplification algorithms were used to extract and process rPPG signals. Then, noise reduction was performed based on the MUSIC algorithm to accurately estimate heart rate. Finally, remote non-contact heart rate detection was achieved to assist medical communication and help users estimate heart rate in real-time.

* <b>November, 2021 - September, 2022: Principle Analysis, Identification and Detection, and Simulation Construction of Phishing Websites</b>
  * Sichuan University
  * Studied the principles of phishing websites, identification and detection techniques, and the design of anti phishing software. At the same time, a simple phishing website was created, simulating the principles of phishing websites and building a phishing website model. Then preliminary anti phishing website detection was carried out, which was able to detect some phishing websites. This detection method was tested, and the detection rate and specific forms of phishing websites targeted by this detection method were summarized.
  * Advisor: Peng Wang
