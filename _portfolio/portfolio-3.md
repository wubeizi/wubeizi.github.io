It should have functions such as providing specific enrollment information of universities, providing comprehensive comparative analysis of target universities, and ultimately helping users complete satisfactory volunteer applications. The system provides users with information display of all 985/211 universities in China, providing comprehensive comparative analysis and enrollment information analysis among target universities, and realizing the analysis and recommendation function of universities.🖥️📶<br/>

- <b>Login</b>🔑: The user enters the homepage, enters their nickname and password in the login box, and clicks the button to enter the background for verification. If the verification is successful, they enter the smart university big data platform. If the verification is not successful, they will go to the login box and be prompted with the reason for the user's error. This process continues until the user information is verified, followed by subsequent operations that pass the verification until the end.<br/><img src='/images/UARS/UARS7.png'>
